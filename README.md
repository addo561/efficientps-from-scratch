# EfficientPS-PyTorch

Efficient Panoptic Segmentation with EfficientNet backbone. Implements MBConv blocks with Squeeze-and-Excitation attention for unified scene understanding.

**Status**: Building EfficientNet backbone with SE-MBConv blocks. Panoptic heads upcoming.

**Structure**: Backbone → BiFPN → Semantic/Instance Heads → Panoptic Fusion

**Goal**: Real-time panoptic segmentation with efficient architecture.
